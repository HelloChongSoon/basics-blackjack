/* 
Introduction
Implement a simplified version of Blackjack. 
There will be only two players. One human and one computer.
The computer will always be the dealer. The dealer has to hit if their hand is below 17.
The player who is closer to 21 wins the hand. Aces can be 1 or 11.
    
Base
Gameplay Description
The main function runs on each player's turn. The sequence of actions in the game might be the following.
    
Deck is shuffled.

User clicks Submit to deal cards.

The cards are analysed for game winning conditions, e.g. Blackjack.

The cards are displayed to the user.

The user decides whether to hit or stand, using the submit button to submit their choice.


The user's cards are analysed for winning or losing conditions.

The computer decides to hit or stand automatically based on game rules.

The game either ends or continues.

Note that for the main function to perform different logic on user input, for example when a player decides to hit or stand, we may wish to consider using a new game mode.

General Tips
Creating helper functions can be a powerful way to refactor your code and keep it neat.
Don't be afraid to throw away code, especially if you already know how you would write it better.
Commit your code often, whenever you have a small working version. For example, each action listed above would be a commit. Make concise and precise commit messages so that you can reference your old changes later.
